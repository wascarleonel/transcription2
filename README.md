    <p style = "font-size: 16px;">Interviewer: Ok, basically the idea we have is how to choose personalities from different areas so that they can tell us a little about how it was in 2012, what their main achievements were and also so that we can give a positive message to the country for the arrival of 2013, there is a lot of pessimism for all the things that are coming, but we really believe so, that 2013 is going to be a good year and we want people to know it from you, that is, you, for example, the artistic part, we have here  a businessman, we have the prosecutor, that is, each one from his area gives an optimistic message.</p>
      
      </div>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">So the first thing is what 2012 meant to you, both personally and generally, how would you define 2012?</p>
    </div>

<div style="height: 4px; width: 28px; background-color: #011F3B;"></div>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; width: 990; font-size: 16px;">Interviewed: You know about those signs that say ¨construction area¨, for me 2012 was a work process, of creating and creating, I finished my first album, I did my first television segment, on a personal level I also think that Being the second year that I had been in .......... I found myself, I found my people, I found what I like to do and I fell more in love with the country so much so that my desire is to stay and keep working here.</p>
