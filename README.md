<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Interviewed: Well, 2012 was a year of many challenges for the justice sector, which is the sector where I work, a year in which issues such as femicides kept us very active, concerned, and developing projects to see how it could be done. reduce to its minimum expression such a serious crime and that generates such a negative impact on society, one of the most relevant issues for us in what has to do with the justice sector is linked to the issue of the new courts, I believe that the implementation or the creation of a new court will protect the fundamental rights of all citizens, it is always an important advance for a country and in that sense I believe that one of the most notorious achievements of 2012 is closely linked to the issue of new courts, historical issues were also raised such as the issue of police reform that is so acclaimed by society and progress has been made on this point and in particular with what has to do with the prosecution we have been practically the entire year installing what is the quality system, which is a system based on a European quality model the CAF for its acronym in English and in that sense it has been positive, but with the security issue we understand that it could have been much better and that the authorities that have the commitment to work on the issue of security, we had to do a better job to guarantee citizens a safer city.</p>
